# Information about SASS-Portfolio
 -  I used HTML CSS and SCSS while making this portfolio. 
 -  The site consists of separate pages and I created and coded different scss pages for these pages. 
 -  The site became a multi-page responsive design. 
 -  I used the Media Query feature in this project. I added media queries for different screens. Example: for screens media-xsm, media-sm, media-md, media-lg, media-xl. 
 -  In order to use the same colors and fonts in some parts of the site and on some pages, I assigned variables to the colors and fonts in the variable.scss page.
 -  I used the values I gave to SCSS's @mixin method in many parts of the site with @include as short and concise articles. 
 -  I used the display flex feature and many features of justify-content on the pages of the site.
 -  I used the same css properties in some places with the @exend method of SCSS
